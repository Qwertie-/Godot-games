Memory-game
===========

My first game made with the [godot engine](http://www.godotengine.org)!

The idea of this game is to watch the patern that the squeres light up press them in the same order.

Here is an early screenshot of the game

This game is very similer to [this game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))
