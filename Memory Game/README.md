Memory-game
===========

My first game made with the [godot engine](http://www.godotengine.org)!

The idea of this game is to watch the patern that the squeres light up press them in the same order.

Here is an early screenshot of the game

2. Import this repo into godot
3. Run game

####How to play:
* Press shift to start

* Use the "qwas" keys to repeat the order that they played in




This game is very similer to [this game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))
